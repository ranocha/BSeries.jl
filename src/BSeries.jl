    evaluate(f, u, dt, series, reduce_order_by=0)

Evaluate the B-series `series` specialized to the ordinary differential equation
``u'(t) = f(u(t))`` with vector field `f` and dependent variables `u` for a
time step size `dt`.

Here, `u` is assumed to be a vector of symbolic variables and `f` is assumed
to be a vector of expressions in these variables for plain B-series. For
B-series with colored trees, `f` must be a tuple of vectors of expressions in
the variables `u`. Currently, symbolic variables from

- [SymEngine.jl](https://github.com/symengine/SymEngine.jl),
- [SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl), and
- [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)

are supported.

The powers of `dt` can be controlled by `reduce_order_by` to make them different
from the usual `order(t)` for a rooted tree `t`. This can be useful in the
context of [`modified_equation`](@ref)s or [`modifying_integrator`](@ref)s,
where the B-series coeffcients are those of ``h fâ``, i.e., they contain an
additional power of `dt`. In this case, the B-series of the vector field can
be obtained using `reduce_order_by = 1`.

    modified_equation(series_integrator)

Compute the B-series of the modified equation of the time integration method

Given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) ``u'(t) = f(u(t))`` and a
Runge-Kutta method, the idea is to interpret the numerical solution with
given time step size as exact solution of a modified ODE ``u'(t) = fâ(u(t))``.
This method returns the B-series of ``h fâ``.

    modifying_integrator(series_integrator)

Compute the B-series of a "modifying integrator" equation of the time
integration method with B-series `series_integrator`.

Given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) ``u'(t) = f(u(t))`` and a
Runge-Kutta method, the idea is to find a modified ODE ``u'(t) = fâ(u(t))``
such that the numerical solution with given time step size is the exact solution
of the original ODE. This method returns the B-series of ``h fâ``.

!!! note "Normalization by elementary differentials"

    multiplied by a power of the time step divided by the `symmetry` of the
    rooted tree and multiplied by the corresponding elementary differential
