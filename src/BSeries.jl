Return a truncated B-series up to the specified `order` with coefficients
determined by `f`. The type of rooted trees is determined by the `iterator_type`,
which can be `RootedTreeIterator` or `BicoloredRootedTreeIterator`. Calling
`f(t, series)` needs to return the coefficient of the rooted tree `t` of the
desired series in a type-stable manner. For the empty tree, `f` is called as
`f(t, nothing)`. Otherwise, the series constructed so far is passed as second
argument, allowing one to access values of lower-order trees.

!!! note "Normalization by elementary differentials"
    The coefficients of the B-series returned by this method need to be
    multiplied by a power of the time step divided by the `symmetry` of the
    rooted tree and multiplied by the corresponding elementary differential
    of the input vector field ``f``.

    evaluate(f, u, dt, series, reduce_order_by=0)

Evaluate the B-series `series` specialized to the ordinary differential equation
``u'(t) = f(u(t))`` with vector field `f` and dependent variables `u` for a
time step size `dt`.

Here, `u` is assumed to be a vector of symbolic variables and `f` is assumed
to be a vector of expressions in these variables for plain B-series. For
B-series with colored trees, `f` must be a tuple of vectors of expressions in
the variables `u`. Currently, symbolic variables from

- [SymEngine.jl](https://github.com/symengine/SymEngine.jl),
- [SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl), and
- [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)

are supported.

The powers of `dt` can be controlled by `reduce_order_by` to make them different
from the usual `order(t)` for a rooted tree `t`. This can be useful in the
context of [`modified_equation`](@ref)s or [`modifying_integrator`](@ref)s,
where the B-series coefficients are those of ``h fâ``, i.e., they contain an
additional power of `dt`. In this case, the B-series of the vector field can
be obtained using `reduce_order_by = 1`.

Compute the B-series of the modified equation of the time integration method

Compute the B-series of the [`modifying_integrator`](@ref) equation of the

`order` with respect to the ordinary differential equation ``u'(t) = f(u(t))``

Here, `u` is assumed to be a vector of symbolic variables and `f` is assumed
to be a vector of expressions in these variables for plain B-series. For
B-series with colored trees, `f` must be a tuple of vectors of expressions in
the variables `u`. Currently, symbolic variables from
