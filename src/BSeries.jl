    modified_equation(A::AbstractMatrix, b::AbstractVector, c::AbstractVector, order)

Compute the B-series of the modified equation of the Runge-Kutta method with
Butcher coefficients `A, b, c` up to the prescribed `order`.

Given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) ``u'(t) = f(u(t))`` and a
Runge-Kutta method, the idea is to interpret the numerical solution with
given time step size as exact solution of a modified ODE ``u'(t) = fₕ(u(t))``.

!!! note "Normalization by elementary differentials"
    The coefficients of the B-series returned by this method need to be multiplied
    by the corresponding elementary differential of the input vector field ``f``.
