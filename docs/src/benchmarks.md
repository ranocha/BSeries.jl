# Benchmarks

Here, we collect some simple benchmarks of
[BSeries.jl](https://github.com/ranocha/BSeries.jl).
Take them with a grain of salt since they run on virtual machines in the
cloud to generate the documentation automatically. You can of course also
copy the code and run the benchmarks locally yourself.


## Comparing different symbolic packages

Symbolic computations of [`modified_equation`](@ref)s and
[`modifying_integrator`](@ref)s in
[BSeries.jl](https://github.com/ranocha/BSeries.jl)
support

- [SymEngine.jl](https://github.com/symengine/SymEngine.jl),
- [SymPy.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/SymPy.jl), and
- [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)

as symbolic backends. Here, we compare them in the context of the explicit
midpoint method and the nonlinear oscillator ODE

```math
u'(t) = \frac{1}{\| u(t) \|^2} \begin{pmatrix} -u_2(t) \\ u_1(t) \end{pmatrix}.
```

This particular combination of explicit Runge-Kutta method and ODE is special
since the explicit midpoint method is unconditionally energy-conserving for this
problem[^RanochaKetcheson2020].

First, we set up some code to perform the benchmarks. Here, we use a very naive
approach, run the code twice (to see the effect of compilation) and use `@time`
to print the runtime. More sophisticated approaches should of course use
something like `@benchmark` from
[BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl).
However, this simple and cheap version suffices to compare the orders of
magnitude.

```@example nonlinear-oscillator
using BSeries, StaticArrays

function benchmark(u, dt, subs, order)
  # explicit midpoint method
  A = @SArray [0 0; 1//2 0]
  b = @SArray [0, 1//1]
  c = @SArray [0, 1//2]

  # nonlinear oscillator
  f = [-u[2], u[1]] / (u[1]^2 + u[2]^2)

  println("\n Computing the series coefficients:")
  @time coefficients = modifying_integrator(A, b, c, order)
  @time coefficients = modifying_integrator(A, b, c, order)

  println("\n Computing the series including elementary differentials:")
  @time series = modifying_integrator(f, u, dt, A, b, c, order)
  @time series = modifying_integrator(f, u, dt, A, b, c, order)

  substitution_variables = Dict(u[1] => 1//1, u[2] => 0//1)

  println("\n Substituting the initial condition:")
  @time subs.(series, (substitution_variables, ))
  @time subs.(series, (substitution_variables, ))

  println("\n")
end
```

Next, we load the symbolic packages and run the benchmarks.

```@setup nonlinear-oscillator
using SymPy # generates annoying output online when conda installs sympy
```

```@example nonlinear-oscillator
using SymEngine: SymEngine
using SymPy: SymPy
using Symbolics: Symbolics

println("SymEngine")
dt   = SymEngine.symbols("dt")
u    = SymEngine.symbols("u1, u2")
subs = SymEngine.subs
benchmark(u, dt, subs, 8)

println("SymPy")
dt   = SymPy.symbols("dt")
u    = SymPy.symbols("u1, u2")
subs = SymPy.subs
benchmark(u, dt, subs, 8)

println("Symbolics")
Symbolics.@variables dt
u = Symbolics.@variables u1 u2
subs = Symbolics.substitute
benchmark(u, dt, subs, 8)
```

These results were obtained using the following versions.

```@example
using InteractiveUtils
versioninfo()

using Pkg
Pkg.status(["SymEngine", "SymPy", "Symbolics"])
nothing # hide
```
