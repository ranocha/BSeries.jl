# Modifying integrators

This tutorial describes the API of [BSeries.jl](https://github.com/ranocha/BSeries.jl)
related to the notion of *modifying integrators*. Given a first-order autonomous
ordinary differential equation (ODE)

```math
u'(t) = f(u(t))
```

and a B-series time integration method, the idea is to find a modified ODE

```math
u'(t) = f_h(u(t))
```

such that the numerical solution with given time step size of the original ODE
is the exact solution of the modified ODE, see [^ChartierHairerVilmart2007]
and [^ChartierHairerVilmart2010].


## Lotka-Volterra model

Here, we consider the explicit Euler method to solve the classical
Lotka-Volterra model

```math
p'(t) = (2 - q) p,
\quad
q'(t) = (p - 1) q.
```

First, we set up the ODE and compute some numerical solutions using
[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl).

```@example ex:lotka-volterra
using OrdinaryDiffEq, StaticArrays

function f(u, params, t)
  p, q = u
  dp = (2 - q) * p
  dq = (p - 1) * q
  return SVector(dp, dq)
end

u0 = SVector(1.5, 2.25)
tspan = (0.0, 15.0)
ode = ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan)

dt = 0.35
sol_euler = solve(ode, Euler(), dt=dt)
sol_ref = solve(ode, Tsit5())
nothing # hide
```

Next, we look at some phase space plots of the numerical solution.

```@example ex:lotka-volterra
using LaTeXStrings, Plots

fig = plot(xguide=L"$q$", yguide=L"$p$")
default(linewidth=2)
plot!(fig, sol_ref, vars=(2, 1), label="Reference solution")
scatter!(fig, last.(sol_euler.u), first.(sol_euler.u),
         label="Explicit Euler, dt = $dt", )
plot!(fig, xlims=(0.0, 4.0), ylims=(0.0, 2.5))

savefig(fig, "lotka_volterra_original.svg"); nothing # hide
```

The exact solution of this problem is periodic, but the explicit Euler method
produces an unstable trajectory. Here, we used an especially large time step to
more clearly illustrate what will follow, but the qualitative behavior is the
same for any time step size.

Next, we will derive a "modifying integrator". What this means is that we will
determine a perturbed ODE right-hand side (RHS) such that when Euler's method
is applied to the perturbed RHS, the result is the exact solution to the
original Lotka-Volterra system. The perturbed system takes the form of a power
series in the time step size `dt`, and in order to compute with it we will
truncate it at a certain order. We can compare the accuracy (and qualitative
behavior) obtained by truncating at different orders.

Here, we use [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl)
for the symbolic computations.

```@example ex:lotka-volterra
using BSeries, Symbolics

# Explicit Euler method
A = @SArray [0//1;]
b = @SArray [1//1]
c = @SArray [0//1]

# Setup of symbolic variables
@variables dt_sym
u_sym = @variables p q
f_sym = [f(u_sym, nothing, nothing)...]

for truncation_order in 2:4
  series = modifying_integrator(f_sym, u_sym, dt_sym, A, b, c, truncation_order)
  series = Symbolics.substitute.(series, dt_sym => dt)
  modified_f, _ = build_function(series, u_sym, expression=Val(false))
  modified_ode = ODEProblem((u, params, t) -> modified_f(u), ode.u0, tspan)
  modified_sol_euler = solve(modified_ode, Euler(), dt=dt)
  plot!(fig, modified_sol_euler, vars=(2, 1),
        label="Euler, modified ODE order $(truncation_order-1)")
end
plot!(fig, xlims=(0.0, 4.0), ylims=(0.0, 2.5))

savefig(fig, "lotka_volterra_modified.svg"); nothing # hide
```

We see that if we include one additional term, the resulting trajectory still
grows, while with two additional terms the solution appears to be dissipative.
With each additional term, the solution gets closer to the exact solution of
the original problem, and with three added terms it is hard to see the difference
between them at this scale.
